#remember the () when printing!! for print is really print() -- it's a command uwu

print ("Mary had a little lamb.")
print ("Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow') #why is snow a character and not a string?
print ("And everywhere that Mary went...")
print ("." * 10) #this will repeat the string 10 times lol

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

#the comma there, that adds a space. without it, you'll get "SyntaxError: invalid syntax"
print (end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12)

#and yes, this is different from the book. The two print lines just separate the word.




#this was super unfunny.
