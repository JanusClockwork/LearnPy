#yaaay I remembered!!

#remember that literally anything after the octothorpe is ignored/is registered as a comment

#print ("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

#print ("This won't print.")

#print ("This will print.") 

#man I am blind
#also I'm just gonna combine the numbers excercise here so that the numbers match the lesson plan again.
#adding octothorpes to the previous stuff so that it doesn't interfere uwu

print ("I will now count my radioactive chickens:")

print ("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
print ("Roosters", 100 - 25 ^ 3 % 4)

print ("Now I will count the mutant eggs:")

print (3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)
#fyi that / is for a float here, // is no float uwu

print ("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

print (3+2 < 5-7)

print ("What is 3 + 2?", (3 + 2))
print ("What is 5-7?", (5-7))

print ("Oh, that's why it's False.")

print ("How about some more, bih?")

print ("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print ("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print ("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)

#looks like spaces don't matter then, for numbers.
#so you can use those double parentheses too, just in case things don't display right. Of course, it doesn't seem to matter for this example.

#print (1%1, 2%2, 4%2, 7%5, 5%4)

#so the % is a modulus, meaning it divides and returns the value of the remainder... whatever that means. I think it gives decimals......?
