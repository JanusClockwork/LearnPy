#for some reason when I place "%r like that, it adds a space and some single quotes... I wonder why.
#oh, it's cuz %r adds those single quotes. Like, it's meant to place quotes.


#oohh okay:
#s – strings
#d – decimal integers (base-10)
#f – floating point display
#c – character
#b – binary
#o – octal
#x – hexadecimal with lowercase letters after 9
#X – hexadecimal with uppercase letters after 9
#e – exponent notation

#and I'm gonna guess r - literal translation with single quotes

#also Python doesn't belive in comment blocks. Why. Y U liek dis.
